Prioritize hard work and time over ambiguous exams when it come to grading for courses. Intro to engineering or engr 131 is an extremely flawed class. Learning excel and how to use it has been very helpful. However the quiz grading  system is very flawed and the reliance  on a group of students for group projects needs to be changed to help students like myself who do a vast majority on the work and then get penalized while the rest of group just looks at it like its a free grade. Intro courses such as cs159 should be made so they are actually introductory and not made so that students have teach every single topics and how to code by themselves. Overall Purdue has an extremely flawed “learn how to teach yourself method” that really doesn’t work for many. You would think that you guys would realize this after seeing how poorly so many students do grades wise and the overload of classwork and assignments that end up only being worth 10-20% of your total grade.

Actually addressing the issue would necessarily require a radical restructuring to bring student well-being from a fringe concern to a central, organizing focus.
To start, I would kindly suggest getting Purdue Engineering's head out of its ass. The fanciful notions of how ""great"" the College is is far removed from the actual state of affairs and detrimental to the possibility of progress. There's a lot to be done, but you can't do any of it until you accept the true extent of the problem.

They have given me an outlet for stress and a way to make friends, which has been extremely important for me.","Although staff and professors say they care about mental health, the realities of the classes do not support mental health most of the time. So many students in engineering are getting very little sleep because they are just trying to finish everything they need to. Some of this may be due in part to a lack of thorough instruction on homework topics, which forces students to spend more time on each task because they have to learn everything better than it was taught to them. Thus, I think that all Purdue Engineering professors should be thorough in their teaching instead of leaving it mostly up to the students to do in their free time in addition to the homework."

I spend most my time with her throughout the week doing homework and have developed a great study group through our friendship. ","Communication within the department could be improved. This semester I am taking three courses required for my ChemE degree, two of which are in the ChemE department. The homework for all three classes is due Friday at 9:00 AM, 11:30 AM, and 4 PM. This causes a lot of stress, especially on Thursday nights. I frequently don't go to sleep until the early hours of Friday morning each week. This would not be so much an issue if I didn't have other homework that has to also be completed earlier throughout the week. 
Additionally, late required PSOs do not pair well with student life. I have not been able to  participate in several club events due to evening PSOs. I have a PSO Tuesday evening 6:30-8:30 that is a combo recitation and lab, with the lab being due that night at 11:59 PM. 
Finally, this semester my two ChemE classes scheduled their second midterms on the same day. This could have been avoided if there was better communication within the department. Exams, especially in technically focused courses are very mentally draining, and having to take two in one day will not allow me to do my absolute best on both exams. "

There’s two types of free time: time off, and actual free time. Time off is time where a student doesn’t have to be doing anything school or work related. Time off doesn’t usually contain motivation to do things you are passionate about or interested in pursuing. Free time has that motivation to expand oneself. I feel that most of what happens here in Purdue Engineering is time off rather than free time because students are so drained with stressful projects, challenging subjects, and exams. We aren’t robots that are being programmed to be the ideal engineers. We are people, human beings, and when all of our motivation is drained by school, it makes it nearly impossible for us to be creative in our own way and express ourselves. If you want quality, unique work, don’t expect people to complete a project the same way as everybody else in a week. Focus more on individual people using their unique abilities and experiences to develop new ideas that will help progress our modern world, not maintain it by doing the same thing as everybody else. Gives us time to be ourselves and use our skills to benefit the world like aspiring engineers should be doing."

Just an overall increased awareness about student well-being is neglected by most professors here at Purdue. "

The workload is huge and often, the professors teach in a way that requires students to spend significant amounts of time learning the material that they were not able to learn in lecture due to poor teaching skills. For example, students go to their chemistry lecture and watch the professor read off the slides instead of expanding upon and explaining concepts well. Then, they have to spend a lot more time doing all of their work because the teacher did not teach the concepts it covers well. I recommend that Purdue Engineering works towards enabling students to get more sleep by improving teaching methods, perhaps by providing professors with more training on how to teach."

","No, the workload is miserable, I feel like a robot.","Yes, I have met many friends in a club I joined here during my freshman year.","Allow more self-paced lecture styles, i.e. upload all lectures after being recorded. Forcing students to go to lecture for points is an outdated practice that shouldn't exist because a professor has one style and the students may prefer a completely different style, so having the lecture recorded allows the student to slow it down to understand it or speed it up to accelerate learning efficiency. Allowing for the student to have more time to allocate to something they may feel passionate about. Ultimately improving student well-being. 

I know a decent amount of classes do this now, but all of them should. I even have a class where we are forced to come to class to turn in homework by hand in an engineering class. Unbelievably outdated practice that simply wastes the student's time. Online lecturing is the future of lecture-based classes and is to the benefit of all students to have. 

Having the option to go to lecture is good for those who want to go to lecture, but it should be purely optional. Forcing a student to participate in lectures can be good, but can also be done after the recorded lectures as lecture quizzes. "

I have not been able to put in enough time into clubs to become a worthwhile member or make good friends in clubs. The main ones I have tried have been ASCE and SHPE.,Everyone would probably laugh at this because I bet most students do not have an issue and it does not concern the school but there needs to be an emphasis on making time for students to do something other than studying especially going to the gym. Especially classes like Dynamics and all the freshmen engineering ones had constant homeworks due throughout the week and even on Fridays. I realize there are many who able to find a balance with school and free time but many others including me have not been able to.

I have had so many classes that I did not actively know what my grade at the end of the semester would be because I didn't know what kind of curve would be put on it at the end.

Especially for classes where the professor outright tells their students that the textbook is incorrect in many spots. Also I would really appreciate seeing the same urgency getting content posted now like we had last year. Most professors have either slacked off or severely slacked off (I can very clearly name this professor but I will not) and it's only making the overall situation worse for students as we try to adjust in to a so-called ""normal times"" when things clearly aren't normal and in fact worse off then before.

I cannot stress enough how awful this sounds especially since apparently that's supposed to motivate undergrads. I can clearly and confidently say that a huge cohort of us are not motivated by graduate students or professors and it's always the small handful that truly help us, and that in it of itself is a rare commodity. Please provide some sort of incentive or resource (whether that's money or prestige I don't know) to these schools/departments so that it feels like they actually care for their students. Right now all we get is a listening ear (which is great don't get me wrong I really appreciate this) and either a class on probation or no change what-so-ever since the professors don't see how they're negatively affecting like 90% of their students. I only say this because, while there's always going to be complains, seeing the number of students dissatisfied by their professors/departments/Purdue is alarmingly high this semester in my opinion and we don't know how to get effective change rolling when departments aren't making drastic enough moves to make professors either understand or change. Hence why I mention incentives since it's just human nature to work for awards or to avoid negative attention"

We don't all have access to cameras remote to our screens, we don't all have printers by our sides, not all of us can use gradescope properly on our phones.

Look, I know that assumptions have to be made, but in the case of the ones made during the pandemic, I got a strong sense that they were made out of convenience of the policy makers rather than the likelyhood of it being correct. You seriously don't know what it's like to try and take an exam when your screen is bent over so the camera can actually see your hands as required. You seriously don't know what it's like to have tones of wasted memory across all your devices because your Matterials class can't be bothered to do the research on how COVID is transmitted (and again, whether or not a phone can submit directly from a students phone) and insists on scanning in tests despite having them directly in hand already.

Most of my answers to this survey are skewed because of assumptions about my time and energy. The first one for example. I'd LOVE to have enough time to dedicate 3+ hours to writing but after a number crunch that is literally never ending, night after night. I don't really have that energy. Similarly for the second question, I definitely overacheive--but that's not a positive thing; I overachieve because I'm stressed, and frightened of failure as I have classes that are literally threatening to fail anyone who misses a single lab submission.

However, there are many other organizations that promote the importance of self-care and give beneficial tips.","The part of engineering that is most difficult for First Year Engineers to adjust to is the giant leap from senior year of high school to freshman year of college. There is a reason engineers have poor mental health, and it's because the workload is honestly overwhelming. I find it difficult to communicate my worries with professors, as they are much less flexible than high school teachers were. In college, there are no curves, homework extensions, or one-on-one sessions with professors to discuss struggles. It makes it seem like there is a wall between professors and students, which makes the enormous course load even more daunting. If Purdue Engineering could find ways to make it easier for students to connect with professors and ask for help, that would greatly help. "

Mental Health issues wont go away ever because I know that if I dont get a Thesis, my entire MS degree to myself, will be a giant hoax. I come from very rigorous standards of education, to us doing 30 credits of coursework only without any dissertation means NADA, Nothing. Sure. I'll learn a lot but what will I say when I apply for a PhD in some other university- that I DID HOMEWORK AND GOT A?

Purdue Engineering is very difficult and while I am doing well in my classes, the mental health support at this school is abysmal. I have gone to CAPS and have had the therapists my issues were beyond what they could assist with and CAPS also told me they do not diagnose more severe mental health issues. I had to go home during the pandemic to meet with a psychiatrist and therapist because there was no one available at Purdue or in Lafayette that could help me. I personally think Purdue Engineering wreaks havoc on student's mental health and that should not be a barrier to them getting a degree. Mental health issues are not someone's fault and we do not have the resources to get help should we choose to.

Sense of community and develop great connections while applying practical engineering knowledge. ","COVID appeared to be used as an excuse for many classes to put less effort into the instruction. It is very apparent to the students when they are watching lecture videos recorded last year or taking quizzes which have the wrong date/material on them that the professors have not taken the effort to teach this semester and instead are taking the easy path. This is not the case for all of my classes. ME430 is still virtual but all the material is written in synchronous lectures and the professor genuinely cares about his students. To contrast this, ME 363 uses recycled material, has a major disconnect between the professor and students, no clear communication for the class, then they wonder why the average on an exam was a 50%. It speaks volumes that 363 has a 2% penalty for each lecture you miss and 430 has no penalty yet the 430 lectures have near perfect attendance. 
 
TLDR. 
If you don’t recycle material and actually care about your students we have a much better time. If a professor puts no effort into a class and expect students to go above and beyond to make up for this, we can tell and are discouraged.

Feel like barely learned anything my sophomore year.  Idk what I would change, I’m just generally stressed al the time","No.  FYE was a miserable experience.  You made it even worse during the pandemic.  You refused to extend the 4 semester cut off date for FYE students to declare a major despite having an entire semester, debatably 2, wasted from the pandemic.  I had to retake Chem 2 since the transition to online was not handled well and it became impossible for me to keep up with the course work due to my ADHD. Online classes were a bad joke. I don’t feel I learned anything from taking online courses, cause again, I don’t learn will with online courses due to my ADHD.  And honestly, I talked to people without a disability and they said they just stopped logging into lectures since they weren’t getting anything out of it.  
The entire FYE experience has been miserable for me.  I debated dropping out several times.  If I did not have an internship at an engineering firm prior to coming to Purdue I might have left the engineering program. 
But hey at least I’m used to feeling overworked and super anxious about everything now so if that’s what your Goal was congratulations.","No, I haven’t had time to join an organization due to all of the work I have to get done in a week.  I’m finally starting to go to the gym regularly and I’m a junior.  ","  I honestly have no idea.  For a start, make FYE related more to engineering and less about pointless busy work for the first half, and then surprising students with assignments they weren’t given the skills to complete.  Engr 132 was admittedly a better experience than 131, but I struggled with understanding programming so I struggled more in that class.  After retaking 132 I had a much better experience, especially thanks to having a great group that helped me work through problems.

  Engr 131 sucked since we had lectures, full lectures, where nothing of substance was said.  We were given assignments in excel for the first half or 3/4ths of the class without any real instructions on how to use the features we were supposed to use for assignments.  We had a lot of time for “sharing” and “teamwork exercises” tho.  Which were fine for the first day, fun even.  But we had like the first week, maybe 2 weeks, where it was just the same stuff: “you’re all valued”, “you’re all special”, “diversity strengthens the engineering field”.  Yes, I agree with all of that, but how do I use excel?  I was constantly on Microsoft support pages looking up how to do certain functions.  But my “favorite” part was when we were given a group project that required us to do programming we weren’t taught, wiring we learned about in one lecture, and to make a full model.

  In that projects defense, I would have enjoyed it more if the entire 131 class led up to it.  Like we had a unit on programming, a unit on wiring, a unit on model-building, ect, that culminated in the final project.  The biggest reasons I didn’t like the project was because I wasn’t given the resources to feel I was a valuable member of the group.  The other 3 people already knew how to do most of the stuff for our projects, but I was the odd man out who couldn’t do anything right.  It sucked man.  Really a kick in the self-confidence balls.  I was given a project I normally would have loved, but was not given the skills to complete it to an extent I was proud of, and felt like I was constantly holding the group back.

  Sorry if I’m ranting a bit, this survey has dug up some old wounds I think.  I heard from some freshman in my physics class that FYE was even worse during the pandemic.  All 3 of them were women in my lab group who were planning on being engineers.  Two switched out of engineering cause they couldn’t deal with the stress from the work-load from among all their classes (not just engineering department, but the classes required for FYE students as well).  One switched out mid semester cause she was just so miserable.  The both liked engineering, but yea they’re doing something else now.

Hire more mental health professionals for your Push therapy thing as well.  Me and another friend of mine were/are debating seeing a therapist but our other friend mentioned to us the waiting time for a Purdue therapist can be over a year.  Like, guys, that’s unacceptable "

Bottom line: more access to class resources, more flexibility, and more consideration for the student experience","No. In fact, Purdue engineering has made my personal mental health the worst. I think that there are resources like CAPS that are recommended, but it is not recognized that this resource is oversaturated, and does not provide the adequate support that students may need. As a WOC, I think there are often times where there are racial/gendered microaggressions that are not addressed by the college of engineering. The way that FYE weeds out students is a very difficult thing to navigate. ","Yes, I believe that being involved in student organizations has helped me understand that there is a community that I can feel belonging to. ","I think Purdue engineering should in general allow for sick days for students for both mental and physical health. I think that the pandemic has shown more than ever that physical AND mental health are integral for being successful. Returning to normal has taken away the flexibility you can get when you need to take a day because you are sick (physically/mentally). Emphasizing that taking a break is OKAY.  

Another way that Purdue engineering can improve student well-being is by providing comprehensive resources for students who are going through mental health issues (beyond saying just go to CAPS). 

Implement required diversity, equity, and inclusion training for students. Give students who are minorities (race, gender, sexuality, disability) the proper resources to feel safe and accepted in their majors. This is integral for improving 1.) retention of minoritized students and 2.) the wellbeing of all students in general. You create better people => better engineers by allowing students to be successful, rather than pushing them to the brink of exhaustion. "

I’ve made lots of friends in student organizations and even met my girlfriend at one. It’s really nice to meet people with similar passions and build a network of friends. ","I think the biggest detriment to student well being is also one of the biggest advantages to going to Purdue: the challenging work. While homework and exams can be very stressful and lead to terrible sleep schedules, it’s also the hard work that makes a Purdue degree so valuable. I think to help balance this, there could be clearer guidelines for professors when it comes to workloads and exams. I have a few classes with more work than necessary and other classes that assign lengthy homework over breaks or during the week of an exam. More awareness to students total workload (across all classes) and ability to balance multiple difficult classes at once would go a long way in improving mental health and overall well being. "

I think that just comes from the fact that Engineering is already a difficult field, and my own mental slowness does nothing but make everything worse. If I wasn't slow, I would be able to do many things that others can do and have more experiences that would help me. I have said it to many others before, but I did nothing but work on schoolwork during High School, and college is much more time consuming by comparison. Thankfully many of my professors have been understanding, along with Ms. Bell and the DRC allowing for me to have extensions. I just wish that I could remember things better too, especially regarding what I have learned in previous semesters; it would surely save me more time and really help me mentally since I am normally stressed and anxious about the future. If I could remember things better, then I wouldn't have to worry about forgetting important information anymore.","I think that Purdue Students Organizations has tried to help with my personal well-being. I don't do anything but schoolwork because of my slowness, so I end up missing a lot of opportunities that PSO creates unfortunately.","I am unsure what Purdue Engineering can do to improve student well-being, though sometimes I wonder why exams are made such big portions of the overall grades of certain classes; as mentioned before I don't do anything but schoolwork, and I can spend hours studying for a test only to still mess up and not do the best on it. I'm sure that many others have tried their best to keep their grades up, only for something to happen and they lose what they have been working so very hard for. This can be especially the case with Final Exams. I really doubt that anyone wants to forget what they have learned, and sometimes there are people like me who for some reason forget easily even when not being distracted by other things. I do understand that there are people who don't put in all of the effort required, but I'm sure that most students do care and are trying their best despite what certain grades they receive might imply. Perhaps this is not so much an issue with Purdue as much as it is an issue with the world itself; plenty of people try their hardest but don't get what some might assume they deserve for all of their hard work in return. I should probably stop talking about this, as it is just making me feel sad and I still have so much to do before the semester ends."
